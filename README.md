artifact evaluation.

# Quickstart

## Requirements

The following software is required for running this artifact:

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Setup Steps
- Install Docker as described at https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/.

- Download the artifact `Learning-Broadcast-Protocols-with-LeoParDS-artifact.zip `
  from https://zenodo.org/record/`<record>`

- Unzip the artifact:

  **Note:** This will unzip the artifact directory structure and files into the
  current working directory, including the compressed docker image
  `image.tar`.
  ```
  unzip Learning-Broadcast-Protocols-with-LeoParDS-artifact.zip
  ```

1. run ```docker stop bpcodecontainer```

2. run ```docker rm bpcodecontainer```

3. run ```docker rmi bpcode:bpcode```

4. run ```docker build -t bpcode:bpcode .``` or import the image file (i.e. ```docker load -i image.tar```)

   This will import the docker image named `<image-name>`. This might take a few minutes.

5. run ```docker run -d -it --name bpcodecontainer -v .:/code bpcode:bpcode```

6. run ```docker exec -it bpcodecontainer /bin/bash```

  **Note** This will spin up a new docker container in which the following
  steps should be executed.

## Smoke Test Steps   

# -----------TO DO-----------!

**Comment**
After the initial setup of the artifact you should provide a script that
reviewers can execute to run some experiments on a **very small subset**
(ideally within 1-2 minutes).
Provide the output of your run including the required time.
This will help the reviewers during the **smoke test phase** to quickly check
whether the artifact was correctly set up and if it is working as intended.

# Available Bagde

The artifact was uploaded to Zenodo and is available at
https://zenodo.org/record/`<record>` (DOI: `10.5281/zenodo.10968038`).

# Functional Badge

In the paper we run ```generator_and_check_subsume_cs``` for varius inputs and for every one that terminated under our criterion we added to the dataset we exemined.
Since this is random generation of BPs, one may not generated the same set of BPs by itself but it is alright, science we aim to for other foelds to use this tool for theor pwn fields and find new uses for him.

We include the data generated for the experiments in the ```results.csv```. 

***Note:*** Generating the data took several days of compute time on multiple compute nodes using a cluster. The produced files are very large and checking any set of the files will take significant computing time.

# Reusable Badge

In the next sub-sections we discribe in details how one can use the diffrent parts in the code.
Note that the code is well documented so any helper fucntion that isn't describe here can be understood while looking at the code. But in order to not assume taht one is familier with codeing and python in particuler, we describe here with running examples the main parts as also explained in the paper.

## Building the Docker Image

In order to build the Docker image one need first to:
-  Install Docker as described at https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/.
-  The artifact contains all files to build the docker image from scratch as
  follows. In the base directory of the artifact execute the following command
  to generate the `image` Docker image.
  You can also find the file ``commands_to_run.txt`` taht explaines it.
Do as follows:
1. run ```docker stop bpcodecontainer```
2. run ```docker rm bpcodecontainer```
3. run ```docker rmi bpcode:bpcode```
4. run ```docker build -t bpcode:bpcode .```

And now you have a Docker image :)

- Use docker image as described in the "Functional Badge" section. (i.e. from 4. ```docker load -i image.tar```)



# Learning-Broadcast-Protocols-with-LeoParDS

This repository contains the artifacts for the paper ``Learning Broadcast Protocols with LeoParDS''.
It contains all the necesery code and inforamtion for using the code as showen in the paper and for new reserach and experements to be done.

More details on the algorithm and Broadcast Protocols (BPs) can be found in the paper, the rest of this file will explain the input and output file format as well as how to use our program.

## BPGen - BP_generator:
  ```python
class BP_generator:
    def __init__(self, min_number_of_states, min_number_of_act, max_number_of_states=None, max_number_of_act=None,
                 print_info=False):
      ...
      self.number_of_act = na #as defined in the function
      self.number_of_states = ns #as defined in the function
      self.bp: BP_class = self.generate()
      
    def generate(self) -> BP_class:
      ...
      # returnes a BP object that has @number_of_states states and each state
      # has a unique action so it wouldn't be hidden and another @number_of_act
      # randomly distributed actions
```
  Creating a random BP with number of states between 2 and 3 and number of actions between 1 and 2
  
  ```python
  bp = BP_generator(2, 1, 3, 2)
  ```

So a possible randomly generated BP is:
```python
THE BP:
 initial state: 0
 actions: {0: {'a': 0, 'c': 1}, 1: {'b': 0}}
 receivers: {0: {'a': (0, False), 'b': (1, False), 'c': (1, False)}, 1: {'a': (1, False), 'b': (1, False), 'c': (0, False)}}
  ```
This is the result of ```print(bp.bp)```

An illustration of this BP is as follows:

![image](https://github.com/Noa-Izsak/Learning-Broadcast-Protocols-with-LeoParDS/assets/62952579/73fc305e-f98f-48fb-a27e-2959d976b1da)

## CSGen 
### CSGen - run_cs_to_a_limit

Under ```BP_Learn.py``` in class ```BP_run```, you can find the following function:
  ```python
def run_cs_to_a_limit(self, cutoff_limit, sample_limit, minimal=False):
```
The BP that we create this CS for is $self.bp$, cutoff_limit is ${\overline{\mbox{M}}_{p}}$ from the paper, represnting a bound on the number of processes.
This is, in order to ensure termination also in case the given BP does not have a cutoff.
We also have as input a ```sample_limit```, in case you run on a computer with low memory resources, you can bound the size of the sample so if it is too high it will stop.
This function is more direct as there are less inputs to tune, if you do want to make it more personal for diffrent uses see the fucntion below.

### CSGen - run_subsume_cs
Under ```BP_Learn.py``` in class ```BP_run```, you can find the following function:
  ```python
    def run_subsume_cs(self, words_to_add, are_words_given, cutoff_lim=None, time_lim=None, word_lim=None, minimal=False):
        """
        a run that add amount of words_to_add to the cs and run it
        :param minimal: A parameter that is fed to the learning procedure
        :param word_lim: Limitation on amount of word to be generated, in order to help with limited resources
        :param time_lim: If given, this is time limitation in sec
        :param cutoff_lim: If given, then cutoff limitation for running
        :param are_words_given: A boolean value representing whether we create a sample (not necessarily a CS)
        for words_to_add amount or is the words are already given to us
        :param words_to_add: Number of words if are_words_given==False or the set of words if are_words_given==True
        """
      ...
```
As in the previous run function, the BP that we create this CS for is $self.bp$, ```cutoff_lim``` is ${\overline{\mbox{M}}_{p}}$ from the paper, represnting a bound on the number of processes. This run function create a CS for the BP by the algorithm that we created and then potantialy padding it with additional words (```words_to_add```), either create it by itself or randomly generate new words (depends on ```are_words_given```).

## RSGen

### RSGen - no positive ratio
#### RWGen - run_no_cs
Under ```BP_run.py``` in class ```BP_run```, you can find the following function:
```python
  def run_no_cs(self, words_to_add, words_are_given, maximal_procs=20, maximal_length=20, minimal=False):
        """
        if words_are_given==True then words_to_add are sample dictionary.
        otherwise, words_to_add is an int of number of words to add.
        a run that add amount of words_to_add to the cs and run it
        :param minimal: whether we want to invoke BPInfMin or not
        :param words_to_add: int if words_are_given=False, otherwise a dictionary of sample
        :param words_are_given: boolean value
        :param maximal_procs: maximal allowed processes for word in the sample
        :param maximal_length: maximal allowed length of word in the sample
        ...
        """
        char_set = {'positive': {}, 'negative': {}}
        start_time = time.perf_counter()
        if not words_are_given:
            char_set, words_added = self.create_sample(words_to_add, char_set, maximal_procs, maximal_length)
        else:
            char_set = words_to_add
            words_added = words_to_add
        end_time = time.perf_counter()

        learn_bp = LearnerBp(char_set, self.bp, end_time - start_time, words_added)
        ...
        learn_bp.learn(minimal)
        ...
```
Where the function ```create_sample``` expand the given sample (in our case, ```char_set``` which is empty) in ```words_to_add``` amount where ```maximal_procs``` is the maximal number of processes to be considered in the sample resp. ```maximal_length``` for the length of the sample.

```learn_bp``` is a LearnerBp object that the learning procedure will happen upon. sending it to ```learn_bp.learn()``` starts the learning procedure.

Defaultively, ```.learn()``` is for BPInf, if we want BPInfMin we will call it with ```.learn(minimal=True)```.
This sample (that is not necessarily a CS), is for $self.bp$. ``words_to_add`` represents $F_w$ from the paper, ``maximal_procs`` represents $\overline{\mbox{M}}{p}$ and ``maximal_length`` represnts $\overline{\mbox{M}}_{l}$. Where 20 is the defaultive value for both of them.


### RSGen - with positive ratio
#### RPWGen - run_no_cs_pos_perc
Under ```BP_run.py``` in class ```BP_run```, you can find the following function:
```python
    def run_no_cs_pos_perc(self, words_to_add, pos_perc, length_limit=20, procs_limit=20, minimal=False):
        """
        :param minimal: whether we want to invoke BPInfMin or not
        :param words_to_add: int amount of words to add
        :param pos_perc: positive % of total words
        :param length_limit: longest word limit
        :param procs_limit: maximal procs limit
        """
        char_set = {'positive': {}, 'negative': {}}
        start_time = time.perf_counter()
        char_set, words_added = self.create_sample_pos_perc(words_to_add, char_set, pos_perc, length_limit, procs_limit)
        end_time = time.perf_counter()
        learn_bp = LearnerBp(char_set, self.bp, end_time - start_time, words_added)
        ...
        learn_bp.learn(minimal)
        ...
```
Similar to the above, but with the pos_perc option.
This sample (that is not necessarily a CS), is for $self.bp$. ``words_to_add`` represents $F_w$ from the paper, ``pos_perc`` represents $F_r$ from the paper, value between $[0,1]$, ``procs_limit`` represents $\overline{\mbox{M}}{p}$ and ``length_limit`` represnts $\overline{\mbox{M}}_{l}$. Where 20 is the defaultive value for both of them.

### An Example:

Given the folloeing BP:

![image](https://github.com/Noa-Izsak/Learning-Broadcast-Protocols-with-LeoParDS/assets/62952579/c51bd762-488d-4c5e-9d1d-3c8a36d7bf4b)

let's call this BP $B_1$, so for RSGen with this BP and parameters: 
  - $F_w=5$,
  - $\overline{\mbox{M}}_{l}=5$,
  - $\overline{\mbox{M}}{p}=3$
  - $F_r = 0.2$

The output could be the sample
$S=\{(aabab,2,F),(abbb,2,F), (baa,3,T), (bba,2,F), (ba,1,F)\}$.

## BPInf and BPInfMin

For bith of them we run the function ``learn`` taht is under ``BP_Learn.py``. The boolean parameter ``minimal`` in the learn function determend whether we run BPInf (minimal=False) of BPInfMin (minimal=True)

```python
    def learn(self, minimal=False):
```



# Running examples:

***More examples and explanation about the fucntions can be find in the code***

## Example 1:
The results will be saved in teh csv file : BP_results_cs_subsumed
Note, scince this is random generation procedure, we cannot geratnee termination, therfore, running this procedure may result in "print(f"The random generated BP has either no cutoff or it is greater then {cutoff}")". Id it do converage then the procedure will return an appropriate random generated BP and an Infered BP from the sample
```python
  def run_a_random_bp_example(minimal=False):
    if minimal:
        df = pd.DataFrame(columns=min_column)
    else:
        df = pd.DataFrame(columns=non_min_column)
    cutoff = 15
    timer_c = 900 
    word_lim = 1500
    bp = BP_generator(3, 1, max_number_of_act=2)
    learner = BP_run(bp.bp)
    bp_min_acts, bp_min_rec, bp_acts, bp_rec, solution = learner.run_subsume_cs(0, False, cutoff, timer_c, word_lim=word_lim, minimal=minimal)

    if solution['failed_converged']:
        new_row = pd.DataFrame([solution], columns=min_column)
        df = pd.concat([df if not df.empty else None, new_row], ignore_index=True)
        df.to_csv(f'BP_results_cs_subsumed.csv', index=False)
        print(f"The random generated BP has either no cutoff or it is greater then {cutoff}")
    else:
        bp_learned = BP_class(len(bp_acts), bp_acts, 0, bp_rec)
        solution['right_output'] = equivalent_bp(bp.bp, bp_learned, solution['cutoff'])
        print(f"Are the two BP's are equivalent?:", solution['right_output'])

        if minimal:
            bp_learned = BP_class(len(bp_min_acts), bp_min_acts, 0, bp_min_rec)
            solution['minimal_right_output'] = equivalent_bp(bp.bp, bp_learned, solution['cutoff'])
            print(f"Are the two BP's are equivalent?: minimal:", solution['minimal_right_output'])
        new_row = pd.DataFrame([solution],
                               columns=min_column)
        df = pd.concat([df if not df.empty else None, new_row], ignore_index=True)
        df.to_csv(f'BP_results_cs_subsumed.csv', index=False)
```
Where ```learner.run_subsume_cs(0, False, cutoff, timer_c)```
which is equivalent to the CS development by the algorithm that was developed for maximal ```cutoff``` and time_bounding of ```timer_c```

A fucntion that do so is ``run_a_random_bp_example()``

A posible output can be:
```text
  counter:  1
  counter:  2
  SAT
  self known actions  ['d', 'a', 'b', 'c']
  self known states  [0, 1, 2]
  minimal False
  this is the BP:
  acts:{0: {'d': 1, 'a': 1}, 1: {'b': 0}, 2: {'c': 0}}
  rec:{0: {'d': (1, True), 'a': (1, True), 'b': (1, True), 'c': (1, True)}, 1: {'d': (0, True), 'a': (1, True), 'b': (0, True), 'c': (0, True)}, 2: {'d': (0, True), 'a': (0, True), 'b': (1, True), 'c': (0, True)}}
  SMT values constrains
  Are the two BP's are equivalent?: (None, None, True)
```
As we expected, the minimal and the `defaultive returned` BPs are of teh same size (3), because for CS the algorithm guarantees it.

The csv file will look as follows:
|failed_converged |	timeout	| amount_of_states_in_origin	| amount_of_states_in_output |	origin_BP |	output_BP |	cutoff |	CS_development_time |	CS_positive_size |	CS_negative_size |	words_added |	longest_word_in_CS |	solve_SMT_time |	right_output |
|--------- |------|----------|-------|-------|--------------|--------------|-------|--------|-------|-------|-------|------|------|
|FALSE|FALSE|3|3|"states: 3,actions: {0: {'a': 1, 'd': 1}, 1: {'b': 0}, 2: {'c': 0}},initial: 0,receivers: {0: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 1}, 1: {'a': 0, 'b': 0, 'c': 1, 'd': 0}, 2: {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 2, 'd': 0}}"|"states: 3, actions: {0: {'d': 1, 'a': 1}, 1: {'b': 0}, 2: {'c': 0}},initial: 0,receivers: {0: {'d': 1, 'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}, 1: {'d': 0, 'a': 1, 'b': 0, 'c': 0}, 2: {'d': 0, 'a': 0, 'b': 1, 'c': 0}}"|2|0.000421|16|28|{'positive': {}, 'negative': {}}|5|0.0233275|(None, None, True)|

## Example 2:
We can also do so for a given BP, written according to our structure
The following BP $B_1$ is written as follows:

![image](https://github.com/Noa-Izsak/Learning-Broadcast-Protocols-with-LeoParDS/assets/62952579/c5cab17e-1770-40fe-8b3f-373acfc29a4c)

``bp1 = BP_class(2, {0: {'a': 1}, 1: {'b': 0}}, 0, {0: {'a': 1, 'b': 0}, 1: {'a': 1, 'b': 0}})``

I.e., it has $2$ states, action $a$ is broadacsted from state $0$ and landed in state $1$, and action $b$ is broadacsted from state $1$ and land on state $0$. And from both states, the receiving transition $a??$ land on state $1$ while the receiving transition  on action $b$, which is $b??$ land on state $0$.

A fucntion that do so is ``run_a_given_bp_example(bp1)`` for a given bp

And creating a CS and inferring for it will be:
```python
counter:  1
counter:  2
SAT
self known actions  ['a', 'b']
self known states  [0, 1]
minimal False
this is the BP:
acts:{0: {'a': 1}, 1: {'b': 0}}
rec:{0: {'a': (1, True), 'b': (0, True)}, 1: {'a': (0, True), 'b': (0, True)}}
SMT values constrains
Are the two BP's are equivalent?: (None, None, True)
```

## About Broadcast Protocols:

**Broadcast protocols** (in short BPs) are a powerful concurrent computational model, allowing the synchronous communication of the sender of an action with an arbitrary number of receivers. 

The basic model assumes that communication and processes are reliable, i.e., it does not consider communication failures or faulty processes.
BPs have mainly been studied in the context of parameterized verification, i.e., 
proving functional correctness according to a formal specification, for all systems where an arbitrary number of processes execute a given protocol.


The challenge in reasoning about parameterized systems such as BPs is that a parameterized system concisely represents an **infinite family** of systems: for each natural number $n$ it includes the system where $n$ indistinguishable
processes interact. 
The system is correct only if it satisfies the specification for any number $n$ of processes interacting.

### Formal definition - BP

A **broadcast protocol** $B=(S,s_0,L,R)$ consists of a finite set of states $S$ with an initial state $s_0 \in S$, a set of labels $L$
and a transition relation $R\subseteq S \times L \times S$, where $L = \{ a!!, a?? \mid a \in A \}$ for some set of actions $A$. A transition labeled with $a!!$ is a broadcast **sending  transition**, and a transition labeled with $a??$ is a broadcast **receiving transition**, also called a **response**.
