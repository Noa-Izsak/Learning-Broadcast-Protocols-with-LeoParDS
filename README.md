# Learning-Broadcast-Protocols-with-LeoParDS

This repository contains the artifacts for the paper ``Learning Broadcast Protocols with LeoParDS''.
It contains all the necesery code and inforamtion for using the code as showen in the paper and for new reserach and experements to be done.

More details on the algorithm and Broadcast Protocols (BPs) can be found in the paper, the rest of this file will explain the input and output file format as well as how to use our program.

## BPGen - BP_generator
  Creating a random BP with number of states between 2 and 3 and number of actions between 1 and 2
  
  ```python
  bp = BP_generator(2, 1, 3, 2)
  ```

So a possible randomly generated BP is:
```python
THE BP:
 initial state: 0
 actions: {0: {'a': 0, 'c': 1}, 1: {'b': 0}}
 receivers: {0: {'a': (0, False), 'b': (1, False), 'c': (1, False)}, 1: {'a': (1, False), 'b': (1, False), 'c': (0, False)}}
  ```
This is the result of ```print(bp.bp)```

An illustration of this BP is as follows:

## About Broadcast Protocols (in short BPs):

**Broadcast protocols** (in short BPs) are a powerful concurrent computational model, allowing the synchronous communication of the sender of an action with an arbitrary number of receivers. 

The basic model assumes that communication and processes are reliable, i.e., it does not consider communication failures or faulty processes.
BPs have mainly been studied in the context of parameterized verification, i.e., 
proving functional correctness according to a formal specification, for all systems where an arbitrary number of processes execute a given protocol.


The challenge in reasoning about parameterized systems such as BPs is that a parameterized system concisely represents an **infinite family** of systems: for each natural number $n$ it includes the system where $n$ indistinguishable
processes interact. 
The system is correct only if it satisfies the specification for any number $n$ of processes interacting.

### Formal definition - BP

A **broadcast protocol** $B=(S,s_0,L,R)$ consists of a finite set of states $S$ with an initial state $s_0 \in S$, a set of labels $L$
and a transition relation $R\subseteq S \times L \times S$, where $L = \{a!!, a?? \mid a \in A\}$ for some set of actions $A$. A transition labeled with $a!!$ is a broadcast **sending  transition**, and a transition labeled with $a??$ is a broadcast **receiving transition**, also called a **response**.
